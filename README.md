# WE_RESCUE_US

  Idea is to create an application which helps people during and after the natural disasters. Our app will help people to locate the resources, rescue centres, etc.. using bing maps. Our application will allow the users to share their information/message to other individuals without using internet or bluetooth or WiFi. Here we use sound waves to transfer the information from one device to other. In addition to above features, this application will give knowledge about each and every possible diseases which can spread after a disaster. Along with them, this application will specifies the details for preventing the same diseases. 
  
## 1: Map
  At the time of disaster, the basic needs are food, cloth and medicines. In our app the shelter providers, volunteers and others can add their location in the map. The people who are willing to contribute to them, people who are interested in joining them can locate them and make use of it. The needy people can also use the app to identify the resources. 
	
  Thus it will also be helpful for the other city people who are willing to help the victim city by collaborating each other.
 
## 2: Sound and QR
  Our application will allow the users to share the information via sound; independent of internet and the most valuable informations will be available as QR code. So that people can take a print out and paste it for guidance of upcoming people.

### Explanation: 
  Without depending on internet and government, after the few minutes of disaster people can share the information via loudspeakers using our application stating the safe places, rescue missions, etcâ€¦. Now the people who can hear the sound can receive the signal then Understand the information and at last they can again transmit or transfer the sound to other areas.

## 3: Disease prevention and hygiene 
  Our application will be equipped with information about all the possible diseases during the disasters along with their prevention methods and healing tips. In addition to that, the place to check-in for the medical help can be identified using the maps.
